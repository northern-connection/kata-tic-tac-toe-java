# Tic Tac Toe Kata

## Description

In this exercise we'll implement from scratch the Tic Tac Toe Game for two human players using TDD.

The system should detect when a player wins.

You can see the game description in [Tic Tac Toe Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

We must apply Object Calisthenics rules.

## The Rules of Object Calisthenics 

1. One level of indentation per method
2. Don’t use the ELSE keyword
3. Wrap all primitives and Strings
4. First class collections
5. One dot per line
6. Don’t abbreviate
7. Keep all entities small (50 lines)
8. No classes with more than two instance variables
9. No getters/setters/properties
